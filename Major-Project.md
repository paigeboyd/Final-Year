# Major Project - British Sign Language Mixed Reality Concept

### Overview

There are an estimated 9 million people in the UK who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, making deafness the third most common disability in the world. Despite these statistics, British Sign Language (BSL) still isn't a part of the national curriculum in schools, creating a divide between the community, and building barriers between children as they are unable to communicate with children with hearing loss or deafness. This translates into adult life, also. Without even basic knowledge of sign language, we have to rely on text, pen and paper or lipreading to have a conversation with deaf people, making even basic communication difficult and frustrating for both sides. This barrier can have a negative impact on a person's self-esteem and mental health.
The problem today is there aren't many user-friendly resources out there to teach BSL, without going to classes. Most resources involve long, drawn-out videos to follow - some of which don't have subtitles(!). If the content isn't stimulating, people aren't going to want to follow along, especially children, and will probably give up. These resources feel outdated and below par with the rest of the educational apps available today.

I want to change this. My goal is to create an app which is fun and engaging, to encourage people to begin learning British Sign Language, and to engage with the d/Deaf in their community. 

Mixed Reality is a new and emerging technology which is on the rise and is garnering a lot of interest in 2017. It opens up a completely new way to learn and interact with the world. Mixed Reality is when digital objects interact with physical objects in the real world. Users see this through a headset which projects the digital objects into their view.

I want to take advantage of this exciting new technology and create a concept and accompanying app which will incorporate Mixed Reality and learning sign language.

There will be three modes to this concept, alongside an accompanying mobile application:
+ Learning mode for Hearing Users
+ Conversational mode for d/Deaf users
+ Conversational mode for Hearing Users


*Learning Mode for Hearing People:* Animations will show the user how to do the sign with their hands, with interactions signalling when they get it right. A user can look at an object, such as a chair, and the headset will show the outline of the sign in the real world. Animated characters will show users how to do the sign also. Users can also choose to learn specific topics or signs by selecting this through the app.


*Conversational Mode for d/Deaf people:* An animated character will appear in the real world, listening to the speaker and signing alongside them in real time. This will replace the need for expensive interpreters, and break barriers to allow for free-flowing communication.


*Conversational Mode for Hearing People:* Similar to the conversational mode for d/Deaf people, the headset will recognise facial expressions and hand movements and translate the sign language into written english real-time. This text will be visible through the headset


*Accompanying App:* The headset will be accompanied by an app which will allow the users to personalise their experience. For example, choosing their character, setting the environment regarding noise levels, brightness etc, and picking fonts, font size etc for the conversational mode for hearing people. This app will also have a section for learners, where they can pick topics and search for a specific sign. The app will track their progress through each topic based on the user completing each sign.

The app will act as the ‘brain’ of the product. This is where the user will enter their information — name, age, gender, hearing or d/Deaf. Users will be assigned characters based on this information, and can then customise their character through the app, to make it more appealing for them. Other factors such as environment, noise levels, brightness can be controlled via the app to give the users a better experience.


TOUCHPOINTS: I plan on exploring a number of touchpoints to go along with the app to promote learning BSL. These will possibly be in the form of stickers and flash cards, alongside the supporting website to establish the brand and explain how to use it. The website will be aimed at adults; parents/teachers.




### Pros

+ I have experience in building web apps in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I am confident I will be able to build good prototypes.
+ I am currently learning BSL, therefore I am aware of the experience of learning BSL as well as the current market and what resources are currently available.
+ Building this app would be addressing a gap in the market and promoting equality among children from a young age.
+ Having personal experience and being passionate about this matter would keep my interest throughout the duration of the project.
+ There is potential to partner with sign language charities to get their approval/endorsement on the project.
+ This concept is using an exciting emerging technology so it has the potential to attract a lot of interest.
+ I enjoy illustration and am confident in using Adobe Illustrator to create these.


### Cons

- I have limited experience with After Effects, so I will need to learn the software to animate the illustrations.
- I don't have a lot of experience in creating videos, so I will need to learn how to create a video which will demonstrate a concept and make it look interesting.
- I'm not fluent in BSL - I'll need to be cautious that what I'm teaching is correct!!



### How might it be built?

As the technology to create this concept is not currently available/publically available, the Mixed Reality portion of this project will be conceptual. I will bring this concept to life through illustration, animation and photography. 

To show a realistic view of the mixed reality headset and the concept, illustration will be combined with photography, for example the UI will be overlayed on a photograph of an environment it would be used in - the character sitting on a chair or standing beside a person. I will use After Effects to create the characters and allow them to move to demonstrate the signs.

The accompanying mobile app will be a fully functioning prototype created using InVision or another prototyping tool, this will allow for the interactions and back-end part of the app to be demonstrated. I will also build prototypes of the app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Who’s it for?

This concept has a wide target audience. It could be used by children in school with the learning mode to teach hearing children sign langauge. It can also be used by adults with the conversational mode for hearing users, who might need to communicate with d/Deaf people in their jobs. Similarly, d/Deaf people could use the conversational mode for d/Deaf users to communicate with hearing users in their everyday life. The uses are quite wide therefore I don't want to limit the app to one target audience.

I plan to explore the possibility of marketing the concept and app to both children and adults.


### What’s the business model?

This concept will have a one-off payment business model. Essentially, it will be like purchasing an app to go alongside a mixed reality headset. I believe this is a useful business model as it will act as a way to encourage users to continue with their learning; knowing that they will only need to make one payment, rather than a subscription model.
