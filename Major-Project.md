# Major Project - BSL for Kids App

### Overview

There are an estimated 9 million people in the UK who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, making deafness the third most common disability in the world. Despite these statistics, British Sign Language (BSL) still isn't a part of the national curriculum in schools, creating a divide between the community, and building barriers between children as they are unable to communicate with children with hearing loss or deafness. 

Without even basic knowledge of sign language, we have to rely on text, pen and paper or lipreading to have a conversation with deaf people, making even basic commication difficult and frustrating for both sides. This barrier can have a negative impact on a child's self-esteem and mental health.

The problem today is there aren't many user-friendly resources out there to teach BSL, without going to classes, and especially for children. Most resources involve long, drawn-out videos to follow - some of which don't have subtitles(!). If the content isn't stimulating, children and young people aren't going to want to follow along, and will probably give up. These resources feel outdated and below par with the rest of the educational apps available today.

I want to change this. My goal is to create an app which is fun and engaging for children, to encourage them to begin learning BSL in the hopes of carrying it on into later life. 

App will cover the foundations of British Sign Language, and is aimed towards hearing-abled children. The app would introduce the users to sign language through 'lessons'; each lesson covering a different topic. This structure prevents learning BSL from feeling overwhelming and learning happens in small stages.

Users would begin by create a username and password to access their account. Their account will allow them to see the progress they have made and how many lessons they have completed.

Topics would include:
+ The Alphabet (aka Fingerspelling),
+ Numbers, 
+ Basic greetings e.g. Hello, My name is, How are you etc. ,
+ Days of the Week/Dates,
+ Weather,
+ Animals,
+ Family etc.

This could then develop on to teaching the user to sign their name and age, as well as possibly having a quiz with a 'match the sign to the word' style, to test their learning and development.

To increase engagement, users will receive badges OR printable certificates when they complete a full lesson, so they can see their achievement and encourage them to continue their learning. Encouraging messages will be used throughout the app, for example "Well Done! You have finished..." etc. There is a good opportunity for me to use interesting interactions and animations here to really enforce a sense of achievement in the child. 


TOUCHPOINTS: I plan on exploring a number of touchpoints to go along with the app to promote learning BSL. These will possibly be in the form of stickers and flash cards, alongside the supporting website to establish the brand and explain how to use it. The website will be aimed at adults; parents/teachers.

 
The Web App would be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and would be able to be used on all devices with a browser and an internet connection.


### Pros

+ I have experience in building web apps in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I am confident I will be able to build this.
+ I am currently learning BSL, therefore I am aware of the experience of learning BSL as well as the current market and what resources are currently available.
+ Building this app would be addressing a gap in the market and promoting equality among children from a young age.
+ Having personal experience and being passionate about this matter would keep my interest throughout the duration of the project.
+ I can partner with sign language charities to get their approval/endorsement on the app.


### Cons

- I have limited experience with After Effects, so I will need to learn the software to animate the illustrations.
- It's been a while since I last used PHP, I'll need to relearn this.
- I'm not fluent in BSL - I'll need to be cautious that what I'm teaching is correct!!


### How might it be built?

I want to build this project as a web app, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as this is what I have experience in using. Some aspects of the app might need a database to store the images so they can be called upon when needed, so I would need to revisit my knowledge of databases.

I'm going to take an illustrative approach to this project. My [Elements Project](http://www.paigeboyd.co.uk/portfolio/elements/index.html) sticks out when I think of this style as I found it enjoyable and a challenge, which is the experience I want to have during this year. 

As I want this project to be a challenge, I will learn to animate my illustrations using software such as After Effects, which I have very limited experience in using, but I am willing to learn. I will need to find some useful tutorials to do this, as well as establishing a house style for the illustrations to keep them consistent and easy to retain.


### Who’s it for?

My target audience is mainly children from the ages of 7-12. By this stage they would have a sound enough understanding of the English language, and therefore would be able to create the link between the Sign Language gesture, and the English word. Research shows that children adapt and pick up languages easier than adults, so I want to take advantage of this and help build the foundations of British Sign Language while they are in this impressionable age. 

However I do want the app to be usable for adults as well who could be learning BSL with their child, so I want to steer away from having it too child-ish in the illustration style - this just isn't my main target audience.


### What’s the business model?

As this is an educational app, I would hope that parents or schools would be willing to pay for the download. However, I think my best option would be a freemium option, where the initial download is free along with a few lessons or elements to the app, but users can pay to unlock further lessons. 

I am unsure about how much I would charge for the app and this is something I would need to consider when conducting user research; should I put a price on education?


### Questions/What I need to decide on:

+ Business Model: Should I put a price on this app; would a price discourage users?
+ Rewards: Ideas for rewarding kids for completing a lesson - in-app badges, printable certificates?


### BSL Organisations/Charities:
