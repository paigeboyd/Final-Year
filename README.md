# Three Ideas - Paige Boyd

## One: BSL Basics

### Overview

There are an estimated 9 million people in the UK who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, making deafness the third most common disability in the world. Despite these statistics, British Sign Language (BSL) still isn't a part of the national curriculum in schools, creating a divide between the community, and building barriers between children as they are unable to communicate with children with hearing loss or deafness. Without even basic knowledge of sign language, we have to rely on text, pen and paper or lipreading to have a conversation with deaf people, making even basic commication difficult and frustrating for both sides. This barrier can have a negative impact on a child's self-esteem and mental health.

The problem today is there aren't many user-friendly resources out there to teach BSL, without going to classes, and especially for children. Most resources involve long, drawn-out videos to follow - some of which don't have subtitles(!). If the content isn't stimulating, children and young people aren't going to want to follow along, and will probably give up. 

I want to change this. My goal is to create an app which is fun and engaging for children, to encourage them to begin learning BSL in the hopes of carrying it on into later life. Topics would include how to 'fingerspell' the alphabet, numbers, basic greetings and common phrases. This could then develop on to teaching the user to sign their name and age, as well as possibly having a quiz with a 'match the sign to the word' style, to test their learning and development.

This project will be a web app, so I can build it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I plan on creating illustrations and animations to bring the Sign Language gestures to life and make them easier to understand and retain.

I plan on exploring a number of touchpoints to go along with the app to promote learning BSL. These will possibly be in the form of stickers and flash cards, alongside the supporting website to establish the brand and explain how to use it.



### Pros

- I have experience in building web apps in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I am confident I will be able to build this.
- I am currently learning BSL, therefore I am aware of the experience of learning BSL as well as the current market and what resources are currently available.
- Building this app would be addressing a gap in the market and promoting equality among children from a young age.
- Having personal experience and being passionate about this matter would keep my interest throughout the duration of the project.


### Cons

- I have limited experience with After Effects, so I will need to learn the software to animate the illustrations.
- Certain aspects of the app might need images to be stored in a database. I am not completely confident in working with databases so I will need to brush up on my knowledge of this.


### How might it be built?

I want to build this project as a web app, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as this is what I have experience in using. Some aspects of the app might need a database to store the images so they can be called upon when needed, so I would need to revisit my knowledge of databases.

I'm going to take an illustrative approach to this project. My [Elements Project](http://www.paigeboyd.co.uk/portfolio/elements/index.html) sticks out when I think of this style as I found it enjoyable and a challenge, which is the experience I want to have during this year. 

As I want this project to be a challenge, I will learn to animate my illustrations using software such as After Effects, which I have very limited experience in using, but I am willing to learn. I will need to find some useful tutorials to do this, as well as establishing a house style for the illustrations to keep them consistent and easy to retain.


### Who’s it for?

My target audience is mainly children from the ages of 7-12. By this stage they would have a sound enough understanding of the English language, and therefore would be able to create the link between the Sign Language gesture, and the English word. Research shows that children adapt and pick up languages easier than adults, so I want to take advantage of this and help build the foundations of British Sign Language while they are in this impressionable age. 

However I do want the app to be usable for adults as well who could be learning BSL with their child, so I want to steer away from having it too child-ish in the illustration style - this just isn't my main target audience.


### What’s the business model?

As this is an educational app, I would hope that parents or schools would be willing to pay for the download. However, I think my best option would be a freemium option, where the initial download is free along with a few lessons or elements to the app, but users can pay to unlock further lessons. 

I am unsure about how much I would charge for the app and this is something I would need to consider when conducting user research; should I put a price on education?

## Two: What's that?

### Overview

What's That? is a mobile app where travelling meets gaming. Using GPS technology, users travel (in real time) around a city, visiting the attractions which act as checkpoints. Users can pick a route to follow based on their interests, for example street art, local food or historical monuments. As they progress through the route and visits each attraction, the app gives information on the attraction, and a quick challenge to complete. Once the user has progressed through the tour and has visited all checkpoints and completed all challenges, they earn a badge, which they can share with friends on social media.

An example: Going on an art tour around Paris. The route leads the user to the Louvre, and challenges them to take a selfie with the Mona Lisa in the background. Once this is done, it's off to the next attraction, where they face the challenge of working out a riddle. And so on...

This app would provide the possibility of collaborating with local businesses in the city to provide real prizes for completing tours, for example vouchers to spend in a local café near the end of the tour.

As this app is intended to be used on the go, I would build it as an iOS mobile app. To do this I would need to use 

Touchpoints to this app would be the supporting website to build the brand and promote the product. 

### Pros

- Travelling is an interest of mine, and this promotes that and will keep my interest during the design and development.
- I have created icons and illustrations of landmarks before, so this will be a chance to build on the skills I learnt previously.
- There aren't too many apps similar to this out there (that I could find, anyway.)
- This game would encourage users to immerse themselves in the history and culture of the city they are visiting.
- This project could give the opportunity to apply for funding to work with a game development company to develop the app further.


### Cons

- I don't have any games experience, so learning something completely new would be a bit of a risk.
- I haven't used Swift before, so I might have to create an interactive prototype instead of a programmed, full working product.
- My experience with After Effects is limited.
- A database would be needed to store all of the attraction information, this in itself could be quite a lot of work.


### How might it be built?

Ideally, the app would be built for iOS devices using Swift. This might be quite difficult for me to learn in the given timeframe of the project, however I am willing to give it a go. I think my best bet could be to build fully interactive prototypes and make use of InVision to allow users to progress through the game and get a feel for the challenges involved in the game. I would place my focus on the illustrations and UI design. I will use Adobe Illustrator to create the illustrations, and After Effects to create the animations.

I quite like the illustration style of [Al Power](https://dribbble.com/shots/3563625-Dublin-Calling) and think it could make for an interesting style in the app's interface. I want to work with a new illustration style for this project and I find his work inspiring.


### Who’s it for?

My main target audience would be young adults, around the age of 18-25. In recent times, travelling has become very popular with this age group, particularly with students during the summer months or on gap years. I think the target audience could be a large amount of people, therefore applying for funding could be interesting to explore during this project.

### What’s the business model?

I think this app would benefit from the freemium business model. With the initial base app being free and two/three standard tours being included within the initial download, users could pay to unlock more tours. The tours which need to be paid for could possibly be more niche to garner interest and appeal to specific types of people.

## Three: 

### Overview

Inspired by a 'choose your own adventure' narrative, this educational story app would teach children about plants/nature. In years two or three of primary school, children begin learning about types of plants, how to keep them alive and their role in nature. This app would teach them these topics through storytelling, letting them choose their way through the story and learning the rewards or consequences of their actions. 

For example, the story teaches the child about the importance of watering plants and brings them to a choice, do they: a) water the plant, or b) not water the plant. If the child chooses path b, they learn the consequence of not watering the plant. If they choose path a, they are shown how the plant will flourish and grow, and are brought to the next part of the story.




### Pros

- Narrative and Storytelling module during Year 2 has given me experience of designing to tell a story.
- I enjoy illustration and creating engaging and fun illustrations for young age groups.


### Cons

- This would be the first time I will have created a choose your own adventure story.
- How would I keep this information interesting to children? Is it too niche?


### How might it be built?



### Who’s it for?

5-8. Years 2/3 in primary school

### Decision

At the moment I'm leaning towards my first idea, the **BSL Basics web app**. Increasing awareness of the need for inclusion of the hearing-impaired in our society is something I am passionate about and I think this will help me work to my full potential when developing the project. Of course, I'm open to other opinions.
