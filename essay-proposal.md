### Title

Gamification and Learning Langauges.



### Research Question

Do Gamified Apps Benefit Secondary Language Learning?



### Introduction

<!-- ~85 words. -->

Technology has revolutionised education within the past decade. What were once textbooks are now interactive applications. The Digital Age has led to the rise of gamification within these applications, forcing educators to embrace this new way of learning. One area that has used gamification techniques to its advantage, is language learning. 

I am going to explore if gamified applications benefit a user when they are learning a second language. Does gamification push learners to reach their goals? Or are we better sticking to traditional methods?





### Section 1: The Rise of Computer Assisted Langauge Learning
<!-- ~216 words. -->
In the first section of this essay, I will define CALL, and exploring how it has evolved over time.

Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) emerged in the 1960s. Defined by Levy (1997) as "the search for and study of applications of the computer in language teaching and learning", CALL enables users to improve their language skills using online resources and assessments. 

Computer Assisted Language Learning began in the sixties, and was behaviouristic. It comprised of drills and practices on mainframe computers, with applications having pre-programmed answers. Users learned through imitation and repetition, focusing on accuracy. 

By the eighties, it became communicative; gaining flexibility and allowing for grammar to be taught implicitly with the introduction of personal computers. CALL boomed at this stage, and applications were being taken seriously.

By the nineties, CALL was integrative. The introduction of multimedia and the CD-ROM enabled users to make use of a variety of media. It took a humanistic approach, with users aiming for fluency. This was when CALL began considering the learner.

More recently in the 2010s, Computer Assisted Language Learning has been redefined as gamified. With the emerging Web 2.0, users have access to online learning platforms, providing real-time feedback and instant access to native speakers. Suddenly gamification made secondary language learning seem achievable.





### Section 2: Competition Equals Motivation
<!-- ~236 words. -->
Articles: USING GAMIFICATION TO ENHANCE 2ND LANG LEARNING & NIR EYAL HOOKED

In this section I will talk about how competitive nature drives us to continue learning, and how this taps into our motivation and drive to seek rewards and achieve our goals.

Gamification is, as Werbach and Hunter (2012) defines it, "the use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts." Gamification works by using game elements to motivate the user. Language learning apps use methods such as collecting points and losing lives, to "hook" the user into continuing to learn languages through playing the game.

The aim to bring out the competitive nature of the user. This competitive personality trait will "contribute positive in successfully learning" a second language. Nir Eyal suggests in Hooked: “there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviours: the user must have sufficient motivation; the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and a trigger must be present.”

If we take a look at Duolingo, they use morale-boosting messages throughout the app to encourage the user, and give them the feeling that they are 'winning' the game.

It is through this method of being motivated to continue playing the game, that the user will continue to learn the language. This can sometimes be a sub-conscious decision the user makes when they are engrossed within the game - a key difference, and benefit, of learning through gamification rather than a traditional textbook.





### Section 3:  Efficiency
<!-- ~175 words. -->
Articles: EXAMINING USE OF GAMIFICATION IN LANG LEARNING APPS & ITS EFFECT ON 2ND LANG ACQUISITION

One of the daunting elements to learning a second language for people is usually the scale of the task at hand. Learners want to be able to achieve fluency quickly and as easily at possible without feeling overwhelmed. Gamified apps today market themselves as solving this exact problem. 

Apps such as Duolingo, Memrise and Babbel are proven to work because of their ability to break the language down into more manageable pieces. For example, rather than looking at the whole topic of grammar, it is broken down into smaller lessons, looking at past, previous and present tenses; one step at a time. Learning iteratively and incrementally means users reach their goals sooner, rather than a process which feels lengthy and unattainable. Hewson (1982) refers to this as the "staging of skills".

Therefore, learning becomes more efficient, as users are somewhat distracted by earning points and, in the case of Memrise, unlocking characters and powers. These apps appeal to the fun side in all of us, and can be more entertaining than sitting in a classroom.





### Section 4:  Teachers Verses Apps
<!-- ~297 words. -->
Articles: EXAMINING USE OF GAMIFICATION IN LANG LEARNING APPS & ITS EFFECT ON 2ND LANG ACQUISITION

This section will explore the topic of teachers verses apps with regards to context, personalisation and relevance.

A key factor the user considers when finding a suitable language learning app, is if it teaches relevant content. Users have different knowledge levels of the language previous to using the app, as well as having their own goals, therefore it is crucial that the content is relevant and targeted. However, this isn't something apps can currently do.

There is some evidence of apps trying to take this into consideration. For example, Memrise asks the user are they "beginners" or "advanced" prior to delivering the content. This will give these users different starting points. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that users will be starting at the correct point with regards to their previous knowledge.

This is where teachers have the advantage over apps. Teachers have the ability to empathise with their students regarding their current situation, age, learning environment and previous knowledge. They form relationships with their students; a source of motivation. Teachers have the ability to tailor their content to suit specific learners, making their experience personalised and more relevant.

For example, adult and child learners. Using the example of Memrise, how would this content be delivered to the child at an advanced level, without using over-complicated language? Similarly, how would an adult receive a beginner's level education of the language, without feeling belittled through use of simplistic language?

This is where teachers step in with the human ability to consider the context of the learner. Alongside this, learning languages requires the experience of speaking to real native speakers. Pre-recorded clips and chatbots are the closest experience an app can provide. In contrast, teachers can provide this on-demand, and adapt the conversation to fit the context.





### Conclusion

<!-- ~90 words. -->

To conclude, gamified apps have a clear benefit when teaching learners a secondary language. It provides new sources of motivation, using the psychology behind human behaviour to "hook" them into continuing to learn a language.

With that being said, apps shouldn't be the sole source of language education. Apps lack the ability to fully personalise their content to ensure it is relevant. This is where a teacher would be more beneficial.  Gamified apps will be beneficial to learners who use them as a complimentary tool in their secondary language education.

Critical Bibliography
---------------------


+ [Computer-Assisted Lanugage Learning: An Overview](https://web.warwick.ac.uk/CELTE/tr/ovCALL/booklet1.htm)
Torat, B. (2001) Computer-Assisted Language Learning: An Overview, Available at: https://web.warwick.ac.uk/CELTE/tr/ovCALL/booklet1.htm (Accessed: 30th October 2017).

This is a useful resource for defining Computer Assisted Language Learning, and exploring the stages of CALL throughout the past six decades. It supports my research question by providing context to language learning. The text introduces the reader to the idea of learning lanuages using online platforms with the introduction of new technologies and how the approach to language learning has changed because of these. The text includes key points for each stage of CALL, and will be my main source of facts.

Eyal, N. (2014) Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products , : Portfolio Penguin

Hooked by Nir Eyal is one of the essentials for learning about habit-forming products; how we can create habits for our users through behavioural techniques. This book explains the theory of the Hook Model, which is the foundation to prove how gamification works when learning languages. I selected this book because it will allow me to provide quotes from an industry expert throughout my essay to back up my argument, as well as allowing me to explore the psychology behind my essay topic. 


+ [Using Gamification to Enhance Second Language Learning by J. Figueroa](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1065005.pdf)
